        Show an error message of the field has been touched AND is empty <br>
        Try leaving the First input field blank:
    </p>

    <form action="" name="myForm">
        <p>Name:
            <input type="text" name="myName" ng-model="myName" required>
            <span ng-show="myForm.myName.$touched && myForm.myName.$invalid">
                The name is required.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            Address:
            <input type="text" name="myAddress" ng-model="myAddress" required>
            <span ng-show="myForm.myAddress.$touched && myForm.myAddress.$invalid">
                The Address is required.
            </span>
        </p>
    </form>
    <p>
        We only user the ng-show directive to only show the error message if the field has been touched AND is empty
